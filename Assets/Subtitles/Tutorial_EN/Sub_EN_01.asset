    kidney. It is here that glucose and sodium are reabsorbed into the blood through
    the sodium-glucose cotransporters that line the wall of this section of the tubule.
    The molecules that are not reabsorbed from the filtrate are expelled from the
    body.\r\n______________________________________________________________________________________\nCastoldi
